face=Tahoma size=2>- variously known as Microcosmic orbit, Small Heaven 
circulation, Small Circulation, Turning the Falun wheel etc.: the circulation of 
Qi along DuMai-RenMai (Governing and Conception vessels respectively). 
Essentials of practice: within a selected posture, gather Qi to DanTian. When it 
has condensed and is moving like a warm stream, guide/ follow the Qi with your 
mind as you relax and allow it to. The path is down from DanTian to Huiyin, 
along Dumai upwards through the points of MingMen, Jiajo, Daizhui, Yuzhen, and 
BaiHui, then downwards through Shenting, Zuqiao, passing the nose and throat, 
down to Tanzhong and then back to DanTian. This is known as the Fire path and is 
represented in illustration to the right. The exact reverse of this is known as 
the Water path.</FONT></P>

width=118></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>There is a third path known as the 
Wind path (shown to the left). This path runs from DanTian, up along the TaiJi 
pole (physiologically the gray matter at the center of the spine, in TCM terms, 
through the Marrow of the Spine), over the falix celebri at the base of the 
brain, and entering into Dumai at the roof of the mouth-tongue junction. The 
general effects of the exercises are to open up and balance the flow along Dumai 
and Renmai, and thus between Yin and Yang. The Daoist Alchemical model stresses 
the function of mixing of Yang Fire (from the Heart and Middle Dantian) and Yin 
Water (from the Kidney) and hence aiding the transformation of Jing into Shen. 
Consistent practice of the exercise will benefit the body's WeiQi (defensive Qi 
field), strengthening immune function and increasing sensitivity and interaction 
with one's environment. If TaiJi, or similar internal art, is practiced, the 
exercise will increase the ability to listen to (and understand) the opponent/ 
partner and to stick-follow. Yu Gongbao expresses it like this:</FONT></P><FONT

one) in conformity with the law of nature and your health will improve a lot."

<P align=justify>Essential Pre-Requsites for Practice</P></FONT></B><FONT 
face=Tahoma size=2>
<P align=justify>Microcosmic Circulation is not a beginner's exercise. It 
requires a substantial supply of Qi in DanTian and experience with feeling Qi 
move and flow, as well as steady concentration and practiced use of intention. 
Any student not possessing these should, under no circumstances, attempt 
Microcosmic circulation. Please note the following from Liu Housheng and Lou 
Peiyu:</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P align=justify>"this exercise is not suitable for beginners. Only when they 
have had considerable practice, and developed sufficient internal Qi can they 
practice this exercise. When the Qi starts functioning you should let it go 
naturally. Never lead it with much effort nor use the mind too early, otherwise 
deviations will occur."</P>
<P align=justify></P></DIR></DIR>
<P align=justify>There are two methods, depending on style of teacher and 
ability/ suitability of student.</P>
<P align=justify></P></FONT><B><FONT face="Gill Sans">
<P align=justify>Method 1: Practice Patiently</P></FONT></B><FONT face=Tahoma 
size=2>
<P align=justify>as already mentioned, Microcosmic circulation will occur when 
DanTian fills with Qi, and subsequent Qi overflows up Dumai. As such, it is not 
necessary to train any special methods: consistent right practice of a static 
posture and a little patience ensure a result. A sitting or standing posture are 
preferred. Breathing will be deep and natural or reverse (paradoxical) depending 
on individual exercise and style of teaching.</P>
<P align=justify>Regulate the breathing to get it even and smooth. Relax the 
body and let the mind rest on DanTian. The mind should follow the Qi, but should 
neither force nor ignore any sensations of the flow or gathering of Qi. Thus be 
an interested observer and note what is happening; do not be a conscious and 
forceful participant. After a certain time of practice (strongly dependent on 
experience, regularity etc.), the DanTian will become substantial with Qi. This 
feeling will increase, and Qi will start to move out from the DanTian like a 
stream of hot air or water. The direction of movement should be down to the 
coccyx, up DuMai, passing over and into RenMai and back to DanTian. Some may 
feel the Qi divide into two after Shenting, moving down past the eyes and along 
the cheek bones before uniting again within the mouth. Here it passes the top of 
the tongue and enters Renmai. The student should not be worried if the full path 
does not open up immediately on feeling Qi move up Dumai. This is natural, and 
to be expected. If the student experiences persistent problems where Qi flows up 
to a specific point and stops as though it meets a dam or blockage, they should 
consult their teacher and maybe read the section on the Spinal Passes below.</P>
<P align=justify>All this will happen naturally if sufficient time and patience 
is allowed. Sometimes there is need to give the Qi a small prompt to begin, in 
which case the principle of 'focusing attention merely when Qi has not started 
to move, and leading Qi to circulate when it is about to move' should be 
followed. At no time should the flow of Qi be forced, or intention be too strong 
and insistent less deviations occur. </P>
<P align=justify></P></FONT><B><FONT face="Gill Sans">
<P align=justify>Method 2: Practice Systematically</P></FONT></B><FONT 
face=Tahoma size=2>
<P align=justify>For those students who require, or those teachers who prefer, a 
more systematic approach, the following, or something similar, is recommended as 
long as caution is followed. A systematic approach is often necessitated for 
those who have not achieved quiescence, or whose patience may fail, or who may 
fall into the trap so that, as no new exercise has been introduced, they cease 
to practice sincerely. In short, it is the easier method, but saves no time and 
greater caution is indicated in its practice. In particular, the supervision of 
an experienced QiGong practitioner is advocated to ensure that progression to 
the next stage is allowed only when the student is ready, and that the flow of 
Qi is unforced by the intention of an overeager mind. In this way, deviations 
will be avoided.</P>
<P align=justify></P></FONT><B></B>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Gill Sans"><B>Exercise 1: Turning the TaiJi 
Ball</B></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma size=2> (or Rotating the DanTian)</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2><IMG align=left height=279 
src="Spinal Passes and the Training of Microcosmic Orbit_files/microball.png" 
width=115></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>When the student is fully relaxed in 
the chosen posture (a natural standing or sitting position is best), and the 
breathing is slow, unforced, and follows the path straight from nose to DanTian, 
the exercise should be introduced.</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>
<P align=justify>On the inhale, the Huiyin should be raised to create a dynamic 
tension. The inhale should be enough to form the DanTian into a ball, but the 
student should not force themselves to breath too deeply. Breathing may be 
regular, or a slight pause may be introduced when the breath is held after the 
inhale. Under no circumstances should this be awkward or uncomfortable. The ball 
will tend to turn backward and upward as shown to the left. The first sensation 
will be experienced by one month of practice. Further practice will bring 
increased degree of rotation, and then an increased number of rotations per 
breath cycle. The exhale should be relaxed and the Huiyin dropped.</P>
<P align=justify>An alternative method requires that, after the inhale with 
Huiyin raising up, Qi should be guided with gentle intention in a triangle from 
Huiyin to MingMen to QiHai. This should be attempted slowly, evenly, naturally, 
and softly. In only a little time, the student will feel the points heating up, 
and a sensation of Qi flow will be achieved some time later.</P>

src="Spinal Passes and the Training of Microcosmic Orbit_files/microhold.png" 
width=176></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>During this article, we shall take the 
Lion Holds Ball posture as an illustration. This is achieved by standing with 
legs shoulder width apart, a slight bend at the knees, arms held out at about 
shoulder height and bent as though clasping a large ball to the chest. It is 
also known as Standing post, or Standing Like a Tree.<BR></FONT><FONT 
size=2><IMG align=right height=281 
src="Spinal Passes and the Training of Microcosmic Orbit_files/microinhale.png" 
width=129></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>On the inhale, raise the Huiyin and 
guide Qi to the coccyx. From here, guide the Qi to flow up the spine (the dorsal 
surface). At the most basic level, the Qi should rise up to the shoulder blades. 
On the exhale, Qi should be guided down the arms and held in circulation within 
the ball. When it is time to finish the exercise, the student should guide the 
stored Qi to flow from within the posture back to DanTian. Qi flow should be 
calm and stabilized before completion of the exercise. This is best achieved by 
reverting to the natural posture held in the exercise before, hands either 
hanging loosely or held infront of DanTian, mind on DanTian, and guide any Qi 
which is still moving back to its source in DanTian. When all feelings have 
settled down, the exercise has ended. A more advanced level is to guide the Qi 
to the crown of the head (the point BaiHui) on the inhale.</FONT></P><FONT 
face=Tahoma size=2>
<P align=justify>On the exhale, the direction of flow is reversed from crown to 
Dantian to nose. On alternate inhales, Qi should be directed from the crown 
along two paths. One reverses the flow to the shoulder blades from where it is 
passed through the arms and into the posture as immediately above. The second 
path continues down from the crown, along the front of the head, and out of the 
nose. It is this, more advanced stage of the exercise, that is illustrated in 
the images above left, and to the right.</P></FONT>

width=176></FONT><B><FONT face="Gill Sans">Exercise 3: Exhale and Inhale Through 
the Soles of the Feet</FONT></B></P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>
<P align=justify>On the inhale, Qi is brought through the nose and drawn up 
through the legs from YongQuan (Kidney 1) situated on the sole of the foot. The 
exhale alternates between a simple reversal of this flow, and storage in the 
posture of Holding Ball. If the student finds it difficult to open up the path 
through the legs, they may focus on achieving this in coordination with the 
breathing without any conscious flow up through the spine. Proceed as follows. 
Perform Turning the TaiJi Ball exercise. Note that on the inhale, the direction 
of rotation is from front to back, from bottom to up. This reverses on the 
exhale, thus pointing directly down the legs. Guide the Qi through the legs to 
YongQuan on the exhale, and reverse the direction for the inhale. The student 
will find this easier to accomplish that the full exercise. Once the student is 
comfortable with this path (this should occur very quickly on feeling the path 
open, though it may take some time to open the path itself), they should proceed 
to the exercise proper.</P>

<P align=justify>Exercise 4: Microcosmic Circulation</P></FONT></B>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2><IMG align=left height=276 
src="Spinal Passes and the Training of Microcosmic Orbit_files/microrbit.png" 
width=121></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>This follows on quite naturally from 
the preceding exercise. There are numerous variations on this final step, and I 
consider here only the simplest. On the inhale, raise Huiyin and lead Qi to the 
DanTian. After the inhale is complete, pause with gently held breath. During 
this pause, lead the Qi up the spine, past the crown, down to the nose tip, and 
finally into Renmai and return to DanTian. Relax the body with the exhale. If 
this exercise is attempted at the correct time, and after patient practice of 
the other exercises, Qi should surge up Dumai like a strong warm stream, and 
trickle easily down Renmai like condensing rain. This is not the end of the 
practice however. Microcosmic circulation must be practiced until it occurs 
naturally, and without the conscious involvement of the practitioner. The path 
will be open, and Qi will flow along it in everyday life as well as during 
QiGong practice. By this stage, the practitioner has reached the same stage as 
someone who has chosen or been instructed in the patient methods of Method 1. 
They are both different in their approach, but they reach the same 
end.</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>To aid the student in their search for Microcosmic circulation, 
suitable dynamic forms should be taught alongside the static practice. The 
purpose of these forms is to relax and open the spine, nourish DanTian, ease 
passage through the spinal passes, and to open up and dredge the two vessels. 
The student need not be aware of this purpose, they only need practice the 
forms. Suitable exercises will be presented in the following section: a 
discussion on the Spinal passes, and how to release and open them if 
blocked.<BR><BR></P></FONT>

<P align=justify><BR>QiGong Deviations and the Spinal 
Passes</P></FONT></U></B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>It would be entirely normal for a person to have restricted 
flow of Qi through one or even all of the passes. A student should be patient as 
to when to begin Xiao Zhou Tian. In particular, there should be sufficient 
supply of DanTian Qi, and the spine should be flexible and strong. Should any 
pass be restricted, the student must not be overanxious as deviations may occur. 
The student should be reassured that gentle and patient practice inevitably 
leads to a natural opening of all of the passes, and Microcosmic orbit will be 
achieved.</P>
<P align=justify>If the student's overanxiousness leads to increasing 
restriction, stasis of Qi and Blood, or even damage to the channel and 
separation of Yin and Yang, an experienced QiGong practitioner or Master should 
be sought. They will ease the blockage by the methods described below, or other 
legitimate techniques. It is to be remembered that it is the malpractice of 
QiGong exercises, and not the exercises themselves, that is the cause of 
deviations.</P>
<P align=justify></P></FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>The existence of the passes/ gates 
refers to specific points along Dumai through which it can be difficult for Qi 
to pass. To experience, maintain, and develop Microcosmic Orbit, it is essential 
that these passes are open, and that they continue so. If any of the passes are 
blocked, the flow of Qi will be hindered and, in severe cases, Qi and Blood will 
stagnate around the point. Remai and Dumai will then be in a state of 
disconnection. Blockages at the points will be felt as aching pain, feeling that 
there is something building up and putting pressure on the point from below, 
feeling of dense lump, constriction, feeling of emptiness above the point, etc. 
Sources differ as to the number of the passes: some say five, others three. They

<P align=justify></P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>Difficulty breathing, shallow or labored breathing, distress: generally 
  due to excessive concentration on the breathing, or too deep breathing 
  restricting oxygen supply. May also accompany other deviations. The body 
  naturally compensates by changing the breathing to a deviation pattern. Relax 
  and carry out natural, relaxed breathing and symptoms will disappear. 
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify></P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>Headache, pulsing head, feeling of distention in the head and neck: due to 
  always concentrating on Qi flow up to BauHui, and neglecting flow back to 
  DanTian. Result is dense, stagnated Qi in the head. Easily prevented by 
  ensuring flow is too and from DanTian, and that the exercise is ended by all 
  Qi returning to source. 
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify></P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>Dizziness, light headedness, syncope: disturbed and interrupted Qi flow, 
  sudden rushing of Qi to the head. Caused by insufficient relaxed 
  concentration, practicing when preoccupied or not properly warmed up and 
  focused, lack of energetic grounding to the Earth. Guide Qi to DanTian, 
  self-massage GB-21, ST-36 and K-1. Develop better easy intention (relaxed 
  focus, concentration) and grounding before returning to exercise. 
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify></P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>Mild pain or discomfort in the knees during standing posture: this is a 
  normal pattern, and should lessen and disappear with practice. Severe or 
  stabbing pain, pain lasting beyond exercise etc. is a deviation. Specific 
  exercises will be recommended to strengthen the knees before returning to 
  standing practice. It is important to ensure that all QiGong exercises obey 
  the rules for correct posture (see elsewhere on the site). 
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify></P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>Experience of lights or sounds (hallucination) during practice: this is a 
  normal pattern and most people will experience it at some stage in their 
  practice. Care should be taken not to become fixated by these experiences, or 
  to willingly seek them out at the expense of what is happening in this 
  practice session, and this moment. This behavior is a psychological deviation 
  and can lead to disconnection with reality. Such a person should be instructed 
  only under the closest supervision of a senior Master. 
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify></P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>Need to pass wind, grumbling stomach: these are normal patterns, and will 
  lessen and disappear with some little practice. They represent an increased 
  flow of Qi to the bowels which respond by functioning at increased efficiency. 
  Consistent practice keeps the efficient state permanently. 
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify></P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>No feeling: the student should not expect to master the exercise in a day. 

  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify></P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>Feeling warm, sweating: due to increased WeiQi circulation. Normal if 
  moderate. Care should be taken to keep dry and not catch chill after the 
  exercise is completed. To this end, always carry an extract jacket etc., and 
  never practice in or near a draft or in a damp environment. 
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify></P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>Feeling cold, chilled: practice should be finished by guiding Qi to 
  DanTian. Drink some warm fluids, perform gentle self-massage, and resume 
  practice the next day.

as follows: when extending and stretching, visualize Yin Qi from the Earth 
traveling up the rear leg, through the spine, up Governing Vessel to BaiHui, 
extending down to YinTang, and both LaoGong points in the palms. While pushing 
outwards from the body, use intention to connect with Yang Qi from Heaven or an 
object on the horizon. As both hands withdraw, shift the weight back to the rear 
leg (it has come forward as the hands have moved forward), contracting the 
spinal column. Each repetition is completed by shifting back to the original 
position and drawing Yin Qi up from YongQuan to DanTian. Repeat nine times, then 
reverse direction for another nine (the breathing also changes such that one 
inhales when stretching forward and exhales when pressing downward). This time, 
visualize Yang Qi descending from Heaven, traveling from BaiHui, down the 
Conception Vessel and out of the front foot, extending deep into the earth. As 
the weight shifts back, use intention to draw Qi from the Heavens into the body 
(down to DanTian) through the head and hands. An important part of the exercise 
is the shifting of the hips to ensure that the spine is stretched without 
causing the balance to topple. This is acheived such that the hands acheive 
their furthest psoition forward when approximately level with the shoulders 
(they may be just below). At this stage, the movement backwards should start 
from the hips - the student should not just fall forward and into the front 
hip.</P>
<P align=justify>Repeat on the other side of the body. Those practicing the 
exercise for a blocked spinal pass will want to carry out the exercise without 
the use of intention (focus on DanTian) until the stasis begins to dissolve. 
Afterwards, perform the exercise as above.</P>

<P align=justify>Begin from a relaxed standing posture. Raise both arms up 
infront of the shoulders and shake vigorously. Draw Qi from Heaven and up from 
Earth, and form a ball in front of the chest (Middle DanTian area). It should be 
possible to feel some sort of resistance to the hands pressing inwards as well 
as feelings of heat, buzzing, aching, fullness etc.</P>
<P align=justify>When you can feel the sensation of the ball between your hands, 
visualize this ball, and the ball at lower DanTian blending and mixing into one 
(this presumes you can feel your DanTian as such - most begginers start out 
without an awareness of DanTian, which slowly changes to a feeling of something 
about the size of a wallnut, and grows from there). This allows for rotatation 
both internally and eternally. Begin rolling the ball, keeping intention focused 
at LaoGong on both palms. As you roll that ball, it grows between the hands. The 
rolling is carried out by hands opposite eachother (one hand up, the other 
down), eighteen times clockwise, eighteen times anti-clockwise. After the last 
rotation, relax back into a natural standing posture.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>This exercise is not really all that dynamic, but the degree of 
Qi movement generated is considerable. Beginners may find it difficult to blend 
the ball held between the hands and DanTian. "Expanding" both outwards until 
they first touch, and then letting the two mix together may help - this makes 
use of the intention (Yi) and should not be carried out until some degree of 
quiescence (calm focus) is acheived.</P>

neck muscles. Care must be taken not to strain or tense the muscles, or 
headaches and a tight and painful neck may result. It forms part of a history of 
Taoist exercises going back 3000 years (it is - probably - found on the 
<I>DaoYin Tu</I> discovered in a Tomb dating from 168BC near ChangSha, Hunan 
province). There are many more of such exercises - the next two areincluded for 
illustrative purposes, as well as being effective in their own right.</P>
<P align=justify>Sit upright with both legs straightened out, heels resting on 
the floor, feet pointing upwards. Raise your hands and keep their fingers 
interlocked overhead. Push hands up with all of the body (as though holding a 
heavy stone between the hands - you should feel the spine stretch upwards. It is 
important to avoid raising and tensing the shoulders and neck). Exhale and place 
hands on top of the head. Repeat nine times. It is important to end the exercise 
properly - any method may be chosen as long as it guides intention and Qi back 
to the Dantian and leaves the mind feeling as though it were resting comfortably 
in the body. No sensation of tightness in the neck or head should occur during 
or after this exercise. Some gentle massaging or rubbing of the DanTian and neck 
may be done if you so wish.</P></FONT>

Qi, aid against Lumbago, tightness of the chest, dyspnea, and arthrosis.</P>
<P align=justify>Stand at ease with feet shoulder-width apart and hands clenched 
into a loose fist. Slowly bend over and push the fists down as far as you can 
making sure you are opening up through the lower back and shoulders and not 
closing off these areas or forcing the movement. Straighten and raise the fists 
overhead as the spine striaghtens back to its normal position. Inhale before you 
bend down, hold the breath whilst you are bent over, and exhale as you 
straighten out. Return to the beginning and repeat for a total of nine 
times.</P>
<P align=justify>Care should be taken when holding the breath (particularly if 
treating tight chest or dyspnea). At no stage should you feel uncomfortable, out 
of breath, or straining to breathe. In all of these exercises, it is important 
that the body is opening up its joints and not locking into or closing down. 
Frequent mistakes are to actually tense up the lower back and hips when 
performing these exercises - the exact opposite of what is intended. It is 
therefore important to develop an honest attitude to practice - one should not 
deceive oneself that one is doing the exercise correctly if you can still feel 
tension or tightness in the posture or breathing.</P>
<P align=justify>One should use this bio-feedback to resolve the tensions and 
increase the accurateness with which one performs the exercise, the fundamentals 
of structure, and the observation of <I>Liu He</I> (Six Harmonies) when moving. 
In this manner, the exercises will aid the development of a lose spine and the 
induction of Microcosmic Orbit.</P></FONT>
