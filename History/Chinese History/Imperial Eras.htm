came to constitute China Proper was unified for the first time in 221 B.C. In 
that year the western frontier state of Qin, the most aggressive of the Warring 
States, subjugated the last of its rival states. (Qin in Wade-Giles romanization 
is Ch'in, from which the English China probably derived.) Once the king of Qin 
consolidated his power, he took the title <A 
href="http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/picts/firstemperor.gif">Shi Huangdi</A> 
(<IMG src="Imperial Eras_files/shihuangdi.gif"> <A 
href="http://pathfinder.com/@@da9e@7OydAEAQMOw/twep/products/qin/story.html">First 
Emperor</A>), a formulation previously reserved for deities and the mythological 
sage-emperors, and imposed Qin's centralized, nonhereditary bureaucratic system 
on his new empire. In subjugating the six other major states of Eastern Zhou, 
the Qin kings had relied heavily on Legalist scholar-advisers. Centralization, 
achieved by ruthless methods, was focused on standardizing legal codes and 
bureaucratic procedures, the forms of writing and coinage, and the pattern of 
thought and scholarship. To silence criticism of imperial rule, the kings 
banished or put to death many dissenting Confucian scholars and confiscated and 
burned their books (<IMG src="Imperial Eras_files/burnedbooks.gif">). Qin 
aggrandizement was aided by frequent military expeditions pushing forward the 
frontiers in the north and south. To fend off barbarian intrusion, the 
fortification walls built by the various warring states were connected to make a 
5,000-kilometer-long great wall (<IMG src="Imperial Eras_files/greatwall.gif">). 
What is commonly referred to as the <A 
href="http://pasture.ecn.purdue.edu/~agenhtml/agenmc/china/scengw.html">Great 
Wall</A> <IMG align=right alt="[Picture of Great Wall]" border=1 height=98 
hspace=10 src="E:\UMA\Chinese History\Imperial Eras_files\greatwall(1).gif" 
vspace=5 width=105> is actually four great walls rebuilt or extended during the 
Western Han, Sui, Jin, and Ming periods, rather than a single, continuous wall. 
At its extremities, the Great Wall reaches from northeastern Heilongjiang (<IMG 
src="Imperial Eras_files/heilong.gif">) Province to northwestern Gansu (<IMG 
src="Imperial Eras_files/gansu.gif">). A number of public works projects were 
also undertaken to consolidate and strengthen imperial rule. These activities 
required enormous levies of manpower and resources, not to mention repressive 
measures. Revolts broke out as soon as the first Qin emperor <A 
href="http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/anthropology/FirstEmperor.html">died</A> in 210 
B.C. His dynasty was extinguished less than twenty years after its triumph. The 
imperial system initiated during the Qin dynasty, however, set a pattern that 
was developed over the next two millennia.

After a short civil war, a new dynasty, called Han (206 B.C.-A.D. 220), emerged 
with its capital at Chang'an (<IMG src="Imperial Eras_files/long.gif"> <IMG 
src="Imperial Eras_files/an.gif">). The new empire retained much of the Qin 
administrative structure but retreated a bit from centralized rule by 
establishing vassal principalities in some areas for the sake of political 
convenience. The Han rulers modified some of the harsher aspects of the previous 
dynasty; Confucian ideals of government, out of favor during the Qin period, 
were adopted as the creed of the Han empire, and Confucian scholars gained 
prominent status as the core of the civil service. A civil service examination 
system also was initiated. Intellectual, literary, and artistic endeavors 
revived and flourished. The Han period produced China's most famous historian, 
Sima Qian (<IMG src="Imperial Eras_files/simaqian.gif"> 145-87 B.C.?), whose 
Shiji (<A href="http://www.cnd.org/BIG5/Classics/Biography/"><IMG 
src="Imperial Eras_files/siji.gif"></A> Historical Records) provides a detailed 
chronicle from the time of a legendary Xia emperor to that of the Han emperor Wu 
Di (<IMG src="Imperial Eras_files/wu.gif"> <IMG 
src="Imperial Eras_files/di.gif"> 141-87 B.C.). Technological advances also 
marked this period. Two of the great Chinese inventions, paper and porcelain, 
date from Han times. 
<P>The Han dynasty, after which the members of the ethnic majority in China, the 
"people of Han," are named, was notable also for its military prowess. The 
empire expanded westward as far as the rim of the Tarim Basin (in modern 
Xinjiang-Uyghur Autonomous Region), making possible relatively secure caravan 
traffic across Central Asia to Antioch, Baghdad, and Alexandria. The paths of 
caravan traffic are often called the <A 
href="http://www.atm.ch.cam.ac.uk/~oliver/silk.html">"silk route"</A> (<IMG 
src="Imperial Eras_files/silkroad.gif">) because the route was used to export 
Chinese silk to the Roman Empire. Chinese armies also invaded and annexed parts 
of northern Vietnam and northern Korea toward the end of the second century B.C. 
Han control of peripheral regions was generally insecure, however. To ensure 
peace with non-Chinese local powers, the Han court developed a mutually 
beneficial "tributary system" (<IMG src="Imperial Eras_files/tribute.gif">). 
Non-Chinese states were allowed to remain autonomous in exchange for symbolic 
acceptance of Han overlordship. Tributary ties were confirmed and strengthened 
through intermarriages at the ruling level and periodic exchanges of gifts and 
goods. 
<P>After 200 years, Han rule was interrupted briefly (in A.D. 9-24 by Wang Mang 
or <IMG src="Imperial Eras_files/wangmang.gif">, a reformer), and then restored 
for another 200 years. The Han rulers, however, were unable to adjust to what 
centralization had wrought: a growing population, increasing wealth and 
resultant financial difficulties and rivalries, and ever-more complex political 
institutions. Riddled with the corruption characteristic of the dynastic cycle, 
by A.D. 220 the Han empire collapsed. 
<P><A name=disunity>
<H2>Era of Disunity</H2></A>
<P>The collapse of the Han dynasty was followed by nearly four centuries of rule 
by warlords. The age of civil wars and disunity began with the era of the <A 
href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Academy/8100/index.htm">Three 
Kingdoms</A> (Wei, Shu, and Wu, which had overlapping reigns during the period 
A.D. 220-80). In later times, fiction and drama greatly romanticized the reputed 
chivalry of this period. Unity was restored briefly in the early years of the 
Jin dynasty (A.D. 265-420), but the Jin could not long contain the invasions of 
the nomadic peoples. In A.D. 317 the Jin court was forced to flee from Luoyang 
and reestablished 
<P>itself at Nanjing to the south. The transfer of the capital coincided with 
China's political fragmentation into a succession of dynasties that was to last 
from A.D. 304 to 589. During this period the process of sinicization accelerated 
among the non-Chinese arrivals in the north and among the aboriginal tribesmen 
in the south. This process was also accompanied by the increasing popularity of 
Buddhism (introduced into China in the first century A.D.) in both north and 
south China. Despite the political disunity of the times, there were notable 
technological advances. The invention of gunpowder (at that time for use only in 
fireworks) and the wheelbarrow is believed to date from the sixth or seventh 
century. Advances in medicine, astronomy, and cartography are also noted by 
historians.
