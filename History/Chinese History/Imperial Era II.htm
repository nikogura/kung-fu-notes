<P>China was reunified in A.D. 589 by the short-lived Sui dynasty (A.D. 
581-617), which has often been compared to the earlier Qin dynasty in tenure and 
the ruthlessness of its accomplishments. The Sui dynasty's early demise was 
attributed to the government's tyrannical demands on the people, who bore the 
crushing burden of taxes and compulsory labor. These resources were overstrained 
in the completion of the Grand Canal(<IMG 
src="Imperial Era II_files/canal.gif">) --a monumental engineering feat--and in 
the undertaking of other construction projects, including the reconstruction of 
the Great Wall. Weakened by costly and disastrous military campaigns against 
Korea (<IMG src="Imperial Era II_files/korea.gif">)in the early seventh century, 
the dynasty disintegrated through a combination of popular revolts, disloyalty, 
and assassination.

width=240> The Tang dynasty (A.D. 618-907), with its capital at Chang'an (<IMG 
src="Imperial Era II_files/long.gif"> <IMG src="Imperial Era II_files/an.gif">), 
is regarded by historians as a high point in Chinese civilization--equal, or 
even superior, to the Han period. Its territory, acquired through the military 
exploits of its early rulers, was greater than that of the Han. Stimulated by 
contact with India (<IMG src="Imperial Era II_files/india.gif">) and the Middle 
East, the empire saw a flowering of creativity in many fields. Buddhism (<IMG 
src="Imperial Era II_files/buddhism.gif">), originating in India around the time 
of Confucius, flourished during the Tang period, becoming thoroughly sinicized 
and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. Block printing was 
invented, making the written word available to vastly greater audiences. The 
Tang period was the golden age of literature and art. A government system 
supported by a large class of Confucian literati selected through civil service 
examinations (<IMG src="Imperial Era II_files/civilexam.gif">) was perfected 
under Tang rule. This competitive procedure was designed to draw the best 
talents into government. But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang 
rulers, aware that imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and 
warlords would have destabilizing consequences, was to create a body of career 
officials having no autonomous territorial or functional power base. As it 
turned out, these scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities, 
family ties, and shared values that connected them to the imperial court. From 
Tang times until the closing days of the Qing empire in 1911, scholar-officials 
functioned often as intermediaries between the grass-roots level and the 
government. 
<P>By the middle of the eighth century A.D., Tang power had ebbed. Domestic 
economic instability and military defeat in 751 by Arabs at Talas, in Central 
Asia, marked the beginning of five centuries of steady military decline for the 
Chinese empire. Misrule, court intrigues, economic exploitation, and popular 
rebellions weakened the empire, making it possible for northern invaders to 
terminate the dynasty in 907. The next half-century saw the fragmentation of 
China into five northern dynasties and ten southern kingdoms. 
<P><A name=song><IMG src="Imperial Era II_files/song.gif"></A>
<P><IMG align=left alt="[Map of Song]" border=1 height=244 hspace=10 
src="E:\UMA\Chinese History\Imperial Era II_files\song(1).gif" vspace=5 
width=240> But in 960 a new power, Song (960-1279), reunified most of China 
Proper. The Song period divides into two phases: Northern Song (960-1127) and 
Southern Song (1127-1279). The division was caused by the forced abandonment of 
north China in 1127 by the Song court, which could not push back the nomadic 
invaders. 
<P>The founders of the Song dynasty built an effective centralized bureaucracy 
staffed with civilian scholar-officials. Regional military governors and their 
supporters were replaced by centrally appointed officials. This system of 
civilian rule led to a greater concentration of power in the emperor and his 
palace bureaucracy than had been achieved in the previous dynasties. 
<P>The Song dynasty is notable for the development of cities not only for 
administrative purposes but also as centers of trade, industry, and maritime 
commerce. The landed scholar-officials, sometimes collectively referred to as 
the gentry, lived in the provincial centers alongside the shopkeepers, artisans, 
and merchants. A new group of wealthy commoners--the mercantile class--arose as 
printing and education spread, private trade grew, and a market economy began to 
link the coastal provinces and the interior. Landholding and government 
employment were no longer the only means of gaining wealth and prestige. 
<P>Culturally, the Song refined many of the developments of the previous 
centuries. Included in these refinements were not only the Tang ideal of the 
universal man, who combined the qualities of scholar, poet, painter, and 
statesman, but also historical writings, painting, calligraphy, and hard-glazed 
porcelain. Song intellectuals sought answers to all philosophical and political 
questions in the Confucian Classics. This renewed interest in the Confucian 
ideals and society of ancient times coincided with the decline of Buddhism, 
which the Chinese regarded as foreign and offering few practical guidelines for 
the solution of political and other mundane problems. 
<P>The Song Neo-Confucian philosophers, finding a certain purity in the 
originality of the ancient classical texts, wrote commentaries on them. The most 
influential of these philosophers was Zhu Xi (<IMG 
src="Imperial Era II_files/zhuxi.gif"> b1130-1200), whose synthesis of Confucian 
thought and Buddhist, Taoist, and other ideas became the official imperial 
ideology from late Song times to the late nineteenth century. As incorporated 
into the examination system, Zhu Xi's philosophy evolved into a rigid official 
creed, which stressed the one-sided obligations of obedience and compliance of 
subject to ruler, child to father, wife to husband, and younger brother to elder 
brother. The effect was to inhibit the societal development of premodern China, 
resulting both in many generations of political, social, and spiritual stability 
and in a slowness of cultural and institutional change up to the nineteenth 
century. Neo-Confucian doctrines also came to play the dominant role in the 
intellectual life of Korea, Vietnam, and Japan.
