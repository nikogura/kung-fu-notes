<H3>1. The Way</H3>The Way that can be experienced is not true;<BR>The world 
that can be constructed is not true.<BR>The Way manifests all that happens and 
may happen;<BR>The world represents all that exists and may exist.<BR><BR>To 
experience without intention is to sense the world;<BR>To experience with 
intention is to anticipate the world.<BR>These two experiences are 
indistinguishable;<BR>Their construction differs but their effect is the 
same.<BR><BR>Beyond the gate of experience flows the Way,<BR>Which is ever 
greater and more subtle than the world.<BR><A

<H3>2. Abstraction</H3>When beauty is abstracted<BR>Then ugliness has been 
implied;<BR>When good is abstracted<BR>Then evil has been implied.<BR><BR>So 
alive and dead are abstracted from nature,<BR>Difficult and easy abstracted from 
progress,<BR>Long and short abstracted from contrast,<BR>High and low abstracted 
from depth,<BR>Song and speech abstracted from melody,<BR>After and before 
abstracted from sequence.<BR><BR>The sage experiences without 
abstraction,<BR>And accomplishes without action;<BR>He accepts the ebb and flow 
of things,<BR>Nurtures them, but does not own them,<BR>And lives, but does not 
dwell.<BR><A href="http://www.chinapage.com/lz02.gif">[Chinese text]</A>|<A

<H3>3. Without Action</H3>Not praising the worthy prevents contention,<BR>Not 
esteeming the valuable prevents theft,<BR>Not displaying the beautiful prevents 
desire.<BR><BR>In this manner the sage governs people:<BR>Emptying their 
minds,<BR>Filling their bellies,<BR>Weakening their ambitions,<BR>And 
strengthening their bones.<BR><BR>If people lack knowledge and desire<BR>Then 
they can not act;<BR>If no action is taken<BR>Harmony remains.<BR><A

<H3>4. Limitless</H3>The Way is a limitless vessel;<BR>Used by the self, it is 
not filled by the world;<BR>It cannot be cut, knotted, dimmed or stilled;<BR>Its 
depths are hidden, ubiquitous and eternal;<BR>I don't know where it comes 
from;<BR>It comes before nature.<BR><A

<H3>5. Nature</H3>Nature is not kind;<BR>It treats all things 
impartially.<BR>The Sage is not kind,<BR>And treats all people 
impartially.<BR><BR>Nature is like a bellows,<BR>Empty, yet never ceasing its 
supply.<BR>The more it moves, the more it yields;<BR>So the sage draws upon 
experience<BR>And cannot be exhausted.<BR><A

flowing:<BR>Its entrance, the root of the world,<BR>The Way moves within 
it:<BR>Draw upon it; it will not run dry.<BR><A

<H3>7. Complete</H3>Nature is complete because it does not serve 
itself.<BR><BR>The sage places himself after and finds himself 
before,<BR>Ignores his desire and finds himself content.<BR><BR>He is complete 
because he does not serve himself.<BR><A

<H3>8. Water</H3>The best of man is like water,<BR>Which benefits all things, 
and does not contend with them,<BR>Which flows in places that others 
disdain,<BR>Where it is in harmony with the Way.<BR><BR>So the sage:<BR>Lives 
within nature,<BR>Thinks within the deep,<BR>Gives within 
impartiality,<BR>Speaks within trust,<BR>Governs within order,<BR>Crafts within 
ability,<BR>Acts within opportunity.<BR><BR>He does not contend, and none 
contend against him.<BR><A href="http://www.chinapage.com/lz08.gif">[Chinese

<H3>9. Retire</H3>Fill a cup to its brim and it is easily spilled;<BR>Temper a 
sword to its hardest and it is easily broken;<BR>Amass the greatest treasure and 
it is easily stolen;<BR>Claim credit and honour and you easily fall;<BR>Retire 
once your purpose is achieved - this is natural.<BR><A

<H3>10. Harmony</H3>Embracing the Way, you become embraced;<BR>Breathing gently, 
you become newborn;<BR>Clearing your mind, you become clear;<BR>Nurturing your 
children, you become impartial;<BR>Opening your heart, you become 
accepted;<BR>Accepting the world, you embrace the Way.<BR><BR>Bearing and 
nurturing,<BR>Creating but not owning,<BR>Giving without demanding,<BR>This is

<H3>11. Tools</H3>Thirty spokes meet at a nave;<BR>Because of the hole we may 
use the wheel.<BR>Clay is moulded into a vessel;<BR>Because of the hollow we may 
use the cup.<BR>Walls are built around a hearth;<BR>Because of the doors we may 
use the house.<BR>Thus tools come from what exists,<BR>But use from what does 
not.<BR><A href="http://www.chinapage.com/lz11.gif">[Chinese text]</A>|<A

<H3>12. Substance</H3>Too much colour blinds the eye,<BR>Too much music deafens 
the ear,<BR>Too much taste dulls the palate,<BR>Too much play maddens the 
mind,<BR>Too much desire tears the heart.<BR><BR>In this manner the sage cares 
for people:<BR>He provides for the belly, not for the senses;<BR>He ignores 
abstraction and holds fast to substance.<BR><A

<H3>13. Self</H3>Both praise and blame cause concern,<BR>For they bring people 
hope and fear.<BR>The object of hope and fear is the self -<BR>For, without 
self, to whom may fortune and disaster occur?<BR><BR>Therefore,<BR>Who 
distinguishes himself from the world may be given the world,<BR>But who regards 
himself as the world may accept the world.<BR><A

<H3>14. Mystery </H3>Looked at but cannot be seen - it is beneath 
form;<BR>Listened to but cannot be heard - it is beneath sound;<BR>Held but 
cannot be touched - it is beneath feeling;<BR>These depthless things evade 
definition,<BR>And blend into a single mystery.<BR><BR>In its rising there is no 
light,<BR>In its falling there is no darkness,<BR>A continuous thread beyond 
description,<BR>Lining what can not occur;<BR>Its form formless,<BR>Its image 
nothing,<BR>Its name silence;<BR>Follow it, it has no back,<BR>Meet it, it has 
no face.<BR><BR>Attend the present to deal with the past;<BR>Thus you grasp the 
continuity of the Way,<BR>Which is its essence.<BR><A

they can not be understood.<BR>Because they cannot be understood <BR>I can only 
describe their appearance:<BR><BR>Cautious as one crossing thin 
ice,<BR>Undecided as one surrounded by danger,<BR>Modest as one who is a 
guest,<BR>Unbounded as melting ice,<BR>Genuine as unshaped wood,<BR>Broad as a 
valley,<BR>Seamless as muddy water.<BR><BR>Who stills the water that the mud may

flourishing things<BR>Will return to their source.<BR><BR>This return is 
peaceful;<BR>It is the flow of nature,<BR>An eternal decay and 
renewal.<BR>Accepting this brings enlightenment,<BR>Ignoring this brings 
misery.<BR><BR>Who accepts nature's flow becomes all-cherishing;<BR>Being 
all-cherishing he becomes impartial;<BR>Being impartial he becomes 
magnanimous;<BR>Being magnanimous he becomes natural;<BR>Being natural he

<H3>18. Hypocrisy</H3>When the Way is forgotten<BR>Duty and justice

devotion arise;<BR>When a nation falls to chaos<BR>Then loyalty and patriotism

profit<BR>Then waste and theft would disappear.<BR><BR>Yet such remedies treat 
only symptoms<BR>And so they are inadequate.<BR><BR>People need personal 
remedies:<BR>Reveal your naked self and embrace your original nature;<BR>Bind 
your self-interest and control your ambition;<BR>Forget your habits and simplify

impartial and show him the Way.<BR><BR>Why should someone appreciate the 
Way?<BR>The ancients said, "By it, those who seek may easily find,<BR>And those 
who regret may easily absolve"<BR>So it is the most precious gift.<BR><A

<H3>63. Difficulty</H3>Practice no-action;<BR>Attend to do-nothing;<BR>Taste the 
flavorless,<BR>Magnify the small, <BR>Multiply the few,<BR>Return love for 
hate.<BR><BR>Deal with the difficult while it is yet easy;<BR>Deal with the 
great while it is yet small;<BR><BR>The difficult develops naturally from the 
easy,<BR>And the great from the small;<BR>So the sage, by dealing with the 
small,<BR>Achieves the great.<BR><BR>Who finds it easy to promise finds it hard 
to be trusted;<BR>Who takes things lightly finds things difficult;<BR>The sage 
recognizes difficulty, and so has none.<BR><A

<H3>64a. Care at the Beginning</H3>What lies still is easy to grasp;<BR>What 
lies far off is easy to anticipate;<BR>What is brittle is easy to 
shatter;<BR>What is small is easy to disperse.<BR><BR>Yet a tree broader than a 
man can embrace is born of a tiny shoot;<BR>A dam greater than a river can 
overflow starts with a clod of earth;<BR>A journey of a thousand miles begins at 
the spot under one's feet.<BR><BR>Therefore deal with things before they 
happen;<BR>Create order before there is confusion.<BR><A

<H3>64b. Care at the End</H3>He who acts, spoils;<BR>He who grasps, 
loses.<BR>People often fail on the verge of success;<BR>Take care at the end as 
at the beginning,<BR>So that you may avoid failure.<BR><BR>The sage desires 
no-desire,<BR>Values no-value,<BR>Learns no-learning,<BR>And returns to the 
places that people have forgotten;<BR>He would help all people to become 
natural,<BR>But then he would not be natural.<BR><A

<H3>65. Subtlety</H3>The ancients did not seek to rule people with 
knowledge,<BR>But to help them become natural.<BR><BR>It is difficult for 
knowledgeable people to become natural;<BR>So to use law to control a nation 
weakens the nation,<BR>But to use nature to control a nation strengthens the 
nation.<BR><BR>Understanding these two paths is understanding 
subtlety;<BR>Subtlety runs deep, ranges wide, <BR>Resolves confusion and 
preserves peace.<BR><A href="http://www.chinapage.com/lz65.gif">[Chinese

it.<BR>Thereby the river is the master of the valley.<BR><BR>In order to master 
people <BR>One must speak as their servant;<BR>In order to lead people<BR>One 
must follow them.<BR><BR>So when the sage rises above the people,<BR>They do not 
feel oppressed;<BR>And when the sage stands before the people,<BR>They do not 
feel hindered.<BR><BR>So the popularity of the sage does not fail,<BR>He does 
not contend, and no one contends against him.<BR><A

separate from all the world.<BR>I am important because I am separate,<BR>Were I 
the same, I could never be important."<BR><BR>Yet here are three 
treasures<BR>That I cherish and commend to you:<BR>The first is 
compassion,<BR>By which one finds courage.<BR>The second is restraint,<BR>By 
which one finds strength.<BR>And the third is unimportance,<BR>By which one 
finds influence.<BR><BR>Those who are fearless, but without 
compassion,<BR>Powerful, but without restraint,<BR>Or influential, yet 
important,<BR>Cannot endure.<BR><A

<H3>68. Compassion</H3>Compassion is the finest weapon and best defence.<BR>If 
you would establish harmony,<BR>Compassion must surround you like a 
fortress.<BR><BR>Therefore,<BR>A good soldier does not inspire fear;<BR>A good 
fighter does not display aggression;<BR>A good conqueror does not engage in 
battle;<BR>A good leader does not exercise authority.<BR><BR>This is the value 
of unimportance;<BR>This is how to win the cooperation of others;<BR>This to how 
to build the same harmony that is in nature.<BR><A

<H3>69. Ambush</H3>There is a saying among soldiers:<BR>It is easier to lose a 
yard than take an inch.<BR><BR>In this manner one may deploy troops without 
marshalling them,<BR>Bring weapons to bear without exposing them,<BR>Engage the 
foe without invading them,<BR>And exhaust their strength without fighting 
them.<BR><BR>There is no worse disaster than misunderstanding your enemy;<BR>To 
do so endangers all of my treasures;<BR>So when two well matched forces oppose 
eachother,<BR>The general who maintains compassion will win.<BR><A

will result.<BR><BR>Do not take away their lands,<BR>And do not destroy their 
livelihoods;<BR>If your burden is not heavy then they will not shirk 
it.<BR><BR>The sage maintains himself but exacts no tribute,<BR>Values himself 
but requires no honours;<BR>He ignores abstraction and accepts substance.<BR><A

will benefit.<BR>The subtle profit where the bold perish<BR>For fate does not 
honour daring.<BR>And even the sage dares not tempt fate.<BR><BR>Fate does not 
attack, yet all things are conquered by it;<BR>It does not ask, yet all things 
answer to it;<BR>It does not call, yet all things meet it;<BR>It does not plan, 
yet all things are determined by it.<BR><BR>Fate's net is vast and its mesh is 
coarse,<BR>Yet none escape it.<BR><A

<H3>74. Execution</H3>If people were not afraid of death,<BR>Then what would be 
the use of an executioner?<BR><BR>If people were only afraid of death,<BR>And 
you executed everyone who did not obey,<BR>No one would dare to disobey 
you.<BR>Then what would be the use of an executioner?<BR><BR>People fear death 
because death is an instrument of fate.<BR>When people are killed by execution 
rather than by fate,<BR>This is like carving wood in the place of a 
carpenter.<BR>Those who carve wood in place of a carpenter <BR>Often injure 
their hands.<BR><A href="http://www.chinapage.com/lz74.gif">[Chinese

their own lives are maintained,<BR>Their people no longer fear

<H3>76. Flexibility</H3>A newborn is soft and tender,<BR>A crone, hard and 
stiff.<BR>Plants and animals, in life, are supple and succulent;<BR>In death, 
withered and dry.<BR>So softness and tenderness are attributes of life,<BR>And 
hardness and stiffness, attributes of death.<BR><BR>Just as a sapless tree will 
split and decay<BR>So an inflexible force will meet defeat;<BR>The hard and 
mighty lie beneath the ground<BR>While the tender and weak dance on the breeze 
above.<BR><A href="http://www.chinapage.com/lz76.gif">[Chinese text]</A>|<A

<H3>77. Need</H3>Is the action of nature not unlike drawing a bow?<BR>What is 
higher is pulled down, and what is lower is raised up;<BR>What is taller is 
shortened, and what is thinner is broadened;<BR>Nature's motion decreases those 
who have more than they need<BR>And increases those who need more than they 
have.<BR><BR>It is not so with Man.<BR>Man decreases those who need more than 
they have<BR>And increases those who have more than they need.<BR><BR>To give 
away what you do not need is to follow the Way.<BR>So the sage gives without 
expectation,<BR>Accomplishes without claiming credit,<BR>And has no desire for 
ostentation.<BR><A href="http://www.chinapage.com/gnl.html#00">[Go To

<H3>78. Yielding</H3>Nothing in the world is as soft and yielding as 
water,<BR>Yet nothing can better overcome the hard and strong,<BR>For they can 
neither control nor do away with it.<BR><BR>The soft overcomes the hard,<BR>The 
yielding overcomes the strong;<BR>Every person knows this,<BR>But no one can 
practice it.<BR><BR>Who attends to the people would control the land and 
grain;<BR>Who attends to the state would control the whole world;<BR>Truth is 
easily hidden by rhetoric.<BR><A

<H3>79. Reconciliation</H3>When conflict is reconciled, some hard feelings 
remain;<BR>This is dangerous.<BR><BR>The sage accepts less than is due<BR>And 
does not blame or punish;<BR>For harmony seeks agreement<BR>Where justice seeks 
payment.<BR><BR>The ancients said: "nature is impartial;<BR>Therefore it serves 
those who serve all."<BR><A href="http://www.chinapage.com/lz79.gif">[Chinese

far;<BR>Keep weapons and armour, but do not employ them;<BR>Let everyone read

contentment.<BR><BR>So the sage does not serve himself;<BR>The more he does for 
others, the more he is satisfied;<BR>The more he gives, the more he 
receives.<BR>Nature flourishes at the expense of no one;<BR>So the sage benefits 
all men and contends with none.<BR><BR><A

The GNL Tao De Ching. <BR>Copyright (C) 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 Peter A. Merel. 
<H3>Caveat</H3>This document attempts to draw the texts of several popular 
English translations of Lao Tse into a consistent and accessible context. It is 
based on the translations of Robert G. Henricks, Lin Yutang, D.C. Lau, Ch'u 
Ta-Kao, Gia-Fu Feng &amp; Jane English, Richard Wilhelm and Aleister Crowley.
<P>This work is not a translation, but an interpolation. It does not represent 
the original text; the original, if there was an original, has been jumbled, 
mistranscribed and reinterpreted many times over many thousands of years, and is 
here cast into a language that is incapable of presenting its poetic structure 
and philological connections.
<P>Even an original text, translated as faithfully as possible, might remain 
inaccessible to the modern reader unable to place it within its original 
context. The intention of this work is to construct a document that closely 
corresponds with the best modern translations of Lao Tse, but which is blunt, 
easy and useful to read within a modern context.
<P>
