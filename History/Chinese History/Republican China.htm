<P>The republic that <A 
href="http://gio.gov.tw/info/yearbook/biogph.html#yearbook86321">Sun Yat-sen</A> 
(<IMG src="Republican China_files/sunyatsen.gif">) and his associates envisioned 
evolved slowly. The revolutionists lacked an army, and the power of Yuan Shikai 
(<IMG src="Republican China_files/yuanshikai.gif">) began to outstrip that of 
parliament. Yuan revised the constitution at will and became dictatorial. In 
August 1912 a new political party was founded by Song Jiaoren (<IMG 
src="Republican China_files/songjiaoren.gif"> 1882-1913), one of Sun's 
associates. The party, the Guomindang (<IMG 
src="Republican China_files/guomindang.gif"> Kuomintang or KMT--the National 
People's Party, frequently referred to as the Nationalist Party), was an 
amalgamation of small political groups, including Sun's Tongmeng Hui (<IMG 
src="Republican China_files/tongmeng.gif">). In the national elections held in 
February 1913 for the new bicameral parliament, Song campaigned against the Yuan 
administration, and his party won a majority of seats. Yuan had Song 
assassinated in March; he had already arranged the assassination of several 
pro-revolutionist generals. Animosity toward Yuan grew. In the summer of 1913 
seven southern provinces rebelled against Yuan. When the rebellion was 
suppressed, Sun and other instigators fled to Japan. In October 1913 an 
intimidated parliament formally elected Yuan president of the Republic of China, 
and the major powers extended recognition to his government. To achieve 
international recognition, Yuan Shikai had to agree to autonomy for Outer 
Mongolia and Xizang (<IMG src="Republican China_files/xizang.gif">). China was 
still to be suzerain, but it would have to allow Russia a free hand in Outer 
Mongolia and Britain continuance of its influence in Xizang. 
<P>In November Yuan Shikai, legally president, ordered the Guomindang dissolved 
and its members removed from parliament. Within a few months, he suspended 
parliament and the provincial assemblies and forced the promulgation of a new 
constitution, which, in effect, made him president for life. Yuan's ambitions 
still were not satisfied, and, by the end of 1915, it was announced that he 
would reestablish the monarchy. Widespread rebellions ensued, and numerous 
provinces declared independence. With opposition at every quarter and the nation 
breaking up into warlord factions, Yuan Shikai died of natural causes in June 
1916, deserted by his lieutenants. 
<P><A name=nationalism>
<H2>Nationalism and Communism</H2></A>After Yuan Shikai's death, shifting 
alliances of regional warlords fought for control of the Beijing government. The 
nation also was threatened from without by the Japanese. When World War I broke 
out in 1914, Japan fought on the Allied side and seized German holdings in 
Shandong (<IMG src="Republican China_files/shandong.gif">) Province. In 1915 the 
Japanese set before the warlord government in Beijing the so-called Twenty-One 
Demands, which would have made China a Japanese protectorate. The Beijing 
government rejected some of these demands but yielded to the Japanese insistence 
on keeping the Shandong territory already in its possession. Beijing also 
recognized Tokyo's authority over southern Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia. 
In 1917, in secret communiques, Britain, France, and Italy assented to the 
Japanese claim in exchange for the Japan's naval action against Germany. 
<P>In 1917 China declared war on Germany in the hope of recovering its lost 
province, then under Japanese control. But in 1918 the Beijing government signed 
a secret deal with Japan accepting the latter's claim to Shandong. When the 
Paris peace conference of 1919 confirmed the Japanese claim to Shandong and 
Beijing's sellout became public, internal reaction was shattering. On May 4, 
1919, there were massive student demonstrations against the Beijing government 
and Japan. The political fervor, student activism, and iconoclastic and 
reformist intellectual currents set in motion by the patriotic student protest 
developed into a national awakening known as the May Fourth Movement (<IMG 
src="Republican China_files/mayfourth.gif">). The intellectual milieu in which 
the May Fourth Movement developed was known as the New Culture Movement and 
occupied the period from 1917 to 1923. The student demonstrations of May 4, 1919 
were the high point of the New Culture Movement, and the terms are often used 
synonymously. Students returned from abroad advocating social and political 
theories ranging from complete Westernization of China to the socialism that one 
day would be adopted by China's communist rulers. 
<P><A name=warlords>
<H3>Opposing the Warlords</H3></A>The May Fourth Movement helped to rekindle the 
then-fading cause of republican revolution. In 1917 Sun Yat-sen had become 
commander-in-chief of a rival military government in Guangzhou (<IMG 
src="Republican China_files/canton.gif">) in collaboration with southern 
warlords. In October 1919 Sun reestablished the Guomindang to counter the 
government in Beijing. The latter, under a succession of warlords, still 
maintained its facade of legitimacy and its relations with the West. By 1921 Sun 
had become president of the southern government. He spent his remaining years 
trying to consolidate his regime and achieve unity with the north. His efforts 
to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1921 he 
turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The 
Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing 
attacks on "Western imperialism." But for political expediency, the Soviet 
leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly 
established Chinese Communist Party (<IMG src="Republican China_files/ccp.gif"> 
CCP). The Soviets hoped for consolidation but were prepared for either side to 
emerge victorious. In this way the struggle for power in China began between the 
Nationalists and the Communists. In 1922 the Guomindang-warlord alliance in 
Guangzhou was ruptured, and Sun fled to Shanghai (<IMG 
src="Republican China_files/shanghai.gif">). By then Sun saw the need to seek 
Soviet support for his cause. In 1923 a joint statement by Sun and a Soviet 
representative in Shanghai pledged Soviet assistance for China's national 
unification. Soviet advisers--the most prominent of whom was an agent of the 
Comintern, Mikhail Borodin--began to arrive in China in 1923 to aid in the 
reorganization and consolidation of the Guomindang along the lines of the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CCP was under Comintern instructions to 
cooperate with the Guomindang, and its members were encouraged to join while 
maintaining their party identities. The CCP was still small at the time, having 
a membership of 300 in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925. The Guomindang in 1922 
already had 150,000 members. Soviet advisers also helped the Nationalists set up 
a political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques and 
in 1923 sent Chiang Kai-shek (<IMG src="Republican China_files/chiang.gif"> 
Jiang Jieshi in pinyin), one of Sun's lieutenants from Tongmeng Hui days, for 
several months' military and political study in Moscow. After Chiang's return in 
late 1923, he participated in the establishment of the Whampoa (<IMG 
src="Republican China_files/huangpu.gif"> Huangpu in pinyin) Military Academy 
outside Guangzhou, which was the seat of government under the Guomindang-CCP 
alliance. In 1924 Chiang became head of the academy and began the rise to 
prominence that would make him Sun's successor as head of the Guomindang and the 
unifier of all China under the right-wing nationalist government. 
<P>Sun Yat-sen died of cancer in Beijing in March 1925, but the Nationalist 
movement he had helped to initiate was gaining momentum. During the summer of 
1925, Chiang, as commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army, set out 
on the long-delayed Northern Expedition against the northern warlords. Within 
nine months, half of China had been conquered. By 1926, however, the Guomindang 
had divided into left- and right-wing factions, and the Communist bloc within it 
was also growing. In March 1926, after thwarting a kidnapping attempt against 
him, Chiang abruptly dismissed his Soviet advisers, imposed restrictions on CCP 
members' participation in the top leadership, and emerged as the preeminent 
Guomindang leader. The Soviet Union, still hoping to prevent a split between 
Chiang and the CCP, ordered Communist underground activities to facilitate the 
Northern Expedition, which was finally launched by Chiang from Guangzhou in July 
1926. 
<P>In early 1927 the Guomindang-CCP rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary 
ranks. The CCP and the left wing of the Guomindang had decided to move the seat 
of the Nationalist government from Guangzhou to Wuhan. But Chiang, whose 
Northern Expedition was proving successful, set his forces to destroying the 
Shanghai CCP apparatus and established an anti-Communist government at Nanjing 
in April 1927. There now were three capitals in China: the internationally 
recognized warlord regime in Beijing; the Communist and left-wing Guomindang 
regime at Wuhan (<IMG src="Republican China_files/wuhan.gif">); and the 
right-wing civilian-military regime at Nanjing, which would remain the 
Nationalist capital for the next decade. 
<P>The Comintern cause appeared bankrupt. A new policy was instituted calling on 
the CCP to foment armed insurrections in both urban and rural areas in 
preparation for an expected rising tide of revolution. Unsuccessful attempts 
were made by Communists to take cities such as Nanchang (<IMG 
src="Republican China_files/nanchang.gif">), Changsha (<IMG 
src="Republican China_files/changsha.gif">), Shantou (<IMG 
src="Republican China_files/shantou.gif">), and Guangzhou, and an armed rural 
insurrection, known as the Autumn Harvest Uprising, was staged by peasants in 
Hunan Province. The insurrection was led by <A 
href="http://www.idbsu.edu/surveyrc/Staff/jaynes/marxism/bios/mao.htm">Mao 
Zedong</A> (<IMG src="Republican China_files/mao.gif"> 1893-1976), who would 
later become chairman of the CCP and head of state of the People's Republic of 
China. Mao was of peasant origins and was one of the founders of the CCP. 
<P>But in mid-1927 the CCP was at a low ebb. The Communists had been expelled 
from Wuhan by their left-wing Guomindang allies, who in turn were toppled by a 
military regime. By 1928 all of China was at least nominally under Chiang's 
control, and the Nanjing government received prompt international recognition as 
the sole legitimate government of China. The Nationalist government announced 
that in conformity with Sun Yat-sen's formula for the three stages of 
revolution--military unification, political tutelage, and constitutional 
democracy--China had reached the end of the first phase and would embark on the 
second, which would be under Guomindang direction.
