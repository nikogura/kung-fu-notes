<P>On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was formally established, 
with its national capital at Beijing. "The Chinese people have stood up!" 
declared Mao as he announced the creation of a "people's democratic 
dictatorship." The people were defined as a coalition of four social classes: 
the workers, the peasants, the petite bourgeoisie, and the national-capitalists. 
The four classes were to be led by the CCP, as the vanguard of the working 
class. At that time the CCP claimed a membership of 4.5 million, of which 
members of peasant origin accounted for nearly 90 percent. The party was under 
Mao's chairmanship, and the government was headed by Zhou Enlai (<IMG 
src="People's Republic of China_files/chouenlai.gif"> 1898-1976) as premier of 
the State Administrative Council (the predecessor of the State Council). 
<P>The Soviet Union recognized the People's Republic on October 2, 1949. Earlier 
in the year, Mao had proclaimed his policy of "leaning to one side" as a 
commitment to the socialist bloc. In February 1950, after months of hard 
bargaining, China and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Friendship, 
Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, valid until 1980. The pact also was intended to 
counter Japan or any power's joining Japan for the purpose of aggression. 
<P>For the first time in decades a Chinese government was met with peace, 
instead of massive military opposition, within its territory. The new leadership 
was highly disciplined and, having a decade of wartime administrative experience 
to draw on, was able to embark on a program of national integration and reform. 
In the first year of Communist administration, moderate social and economic 
policies were implemented with skill and effectiveness. The leadership realized 
that the overwhelming and multitudinous task of economic reconstruction and 
achievement of political and social stability required the goodwill and 
cooperation of all classes of people. Results were impressive by any standard, 
and popular support was widespread. 
<P>By 1950 international recognition of the Communist government had increased 
considerably, but it was slowed by China's involvement in the Korean War. In 
October 1950, sensing a threat to the industrial heartland in northeast China 
from the advancing United Nations (UN) forces in the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (North Korea), units of the PLA--calling themselves the 
Chinese People's Volunteers--crossed the YaluJiang (<IMG 
src="People's Republic of China_files/yalu.gif">) River into North Korea in 
response to a North Korean request for aid. Almost simultaneously the PLA forces 
also marched into Xizang to reassert Chinese sovereignty over a region that had 
been in effect independent of Chinese rule since the fall of the Qing dynasty in 
1911. In 1951 the UN declared China to be an aggressor in Korea and sanctioned a 
global embargo on the shipment of arms and war materiel to China. This step 
foreclosed for the time being any possibility that the People's Republic might 
replace Nationalist China (on Taiwan) as a member of the UN and as a 
veto-holding member of the UN Security Council. 
<P>After China entered the Korean War, the initial moderation in Chinese 
domestic policies gave way to a massive campaign against the "enemies of the 
state," actual and potential. These enemies consisted of "war criminals, 
traitors, bureaucratic capitalists, and counterrevolutionaries." The campaign 
was combined with party-sponsored trials attended by huge numbers of people. The 
major targets in this drive were foreigners and Christian missionaries who were 
branded as United States agents at these mass trials. The 1951-52 drive against 
political enemies was accompanied by land reform, which had actually begun under 
the Agrarian Reform Law of June 28, 1950. The redistribution of land was 
accelerated, and a class struggle landlords and wealthy peasants was launched. 
An ideological reform campaign requiring self-criticisms and public confessions 
by university faculty members, scientists, and other professional workers was 
given wide publicity. Artists and writers were soon the objects of similar 
treatment for failing to heed Mao's dictum that culture and literature must 
reflect the class interest of the working people, led by the CCP. These 
campaigns were accompanied in 1951 and 1952 by the san fan (<IMG 
src="People's Republic of China_files/sanfan.gif"> or "three anti") and wu fan 
(<IMG src="People's Republic of China_files/wufan.gif"> or "five anti") 
movements. The former was directed ostensibly against the evils of "corruption, 
waste, and bureaucratism"; its real aim was to eliminate incompetent and 
politically unreliable public officials and to bring about an efficient, 
disciplined, and responsive bureaucratic system. The wu fan movement aimed at 
eliminating recalcitrant and corrupt businessmen and industrialists, who were in 
effect the targets of the CCP's condemnation of "tax evasion, bribery, cheating 
in government contracts, thefts of economic intelligence, and stealing of state 
assets." In the course of this campaign the party claimed to have uncovered a 
well-organized attempt by businessmen and industrialists to corrupt party and 
government officials. This charge was enlarged into an assault on the 
bourgeoisie as a whole. The number of people affected by the various punitive or 
reform campaigns was estimated in the millions. 
<P><A name=transition>
<H2>The Transition to Socialism, 1953-57</H2></A>The period of officially 
designated "transition to socialism" corresponded to China's First Five-Year 
Plan (1953-57). The period was characterized by efforts to achieve 
industrialization, collectivization of agriculture, and political 
centralization. 
<P>The First Five-Year Plan stressed the development of heavy industry on the 
Soviet model. Soviet economic and technical assistance was expected to play a 
significant part in the implementation of the plan, and technical agreements 
were signed with the Soviets in 1953 and 1954. For the purpose of economic 
planning, the first modern census was taken in 1953; the population of mainland 
China was shown to be 583 million, a figure far greater than had been 
anticipated. 
<P>Among China's most pressing needs in the early 1950s were food for its 
burgeoning population, domestic capital for investment, and purchase of 
Soviet-supplied technology, capital equipment, and military hardware. To satisfy 
these needs, the government began to collectivize agriculture. Despite internal 
disagreement as to the speed of collectivization, which at least for the time 
being was resolved in Mao's favor, preliminary collectivization was 90 percent 
completed by the end of 1956. In addition, the government nationalized banking, 
industry, and trade. Private enterprise in mainland China was virtually 
abolished. 
<P>Major political developments included the centralization of party and 
government administration. Elections were held in 1953 for delegates to the 
First National People's Congress, China's national legislature, which met in 
1954. The congress promulgated the state constitution of 1954 and formally 
elected Mao chairman (or president) of the People's Republic; it elected Liu 
Shaoqi (<IMG src="People's Republic of China_files/liushaoqi.gif"> 1898-1969) 
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; and named 
Zhou Enlai premier of the new State Council. 
<P>In the midst of these major governmental changes, and helping to precipitate 
them, was a power struggle within the CCP leading to the 1954 purge of Political 
Bureau member Gao Gang (<IMG 
src="People's Republic of China_files/gaogang.gif">) and Party Organization 
Department head Rao Shushi (<IMG 
src="People's Republic of China_files/rao.gif">), who were accused of illicitly 
trying to seize control of the party. 
<P>The process of national integration also was characterized by improvements in 
party organization under the administrative direction of the secretary general 
of the party Deng Xiaoping (<IMG 
src="People's Republic of China_files/deng.gif"> who served concurrently as vice 
premier of the State Council). There was a marked emphasis on recruiting 
intellectuals, who by 1956 constituted nearly 12 percent of the party's 10.8 
million members. Peasant membership had decreased to 69 percent, while there was 
an increasing number of "experts" , who were needed for the party and 
governmental infrastructures, in the party ranks. 
<P>As part of the effort to encourage the participation of intellectuals in the 
new regime, in mid-1956 there began an official effort to liberalize the 
political climate. Cultural and intellectual figures were encouraged to speak 
their minds on the state of CCP rule and programs. Mao personally took the lead 
in the movement, which was launched under the classical slogan "Let a hundred 
flowers bloom, let the hundred schools of thought contend" (<IMG 
src="People's Republic of China_files/bloom.gif">). At first the party's 
repeated invitation to air constructive views freely and openly was met with 
caution. By mid-1957, however, the movement unexpectedly mounted, bringing 
denunciation and criticism against the party in general and the excesses of its 
cadres in particular. Startled and embarrassed, leaders turned on the critics as 
"bourgeois rightists" (<IMG 
src="People's Republic of China_files/rightists.gif">) and launched the 
Anti-Rightist Campaign. The Hundred Flowers Campaign , sometimes called the 
Double Hundred Campaign (<IMG 
src="People's Republic of China_files/double.gif">), apparently had a sobering 
effect on the CCP leadership.
