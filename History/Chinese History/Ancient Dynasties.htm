<P>The first prehistoric dynasty is said to be Xia (<IMG 
src="E:\UMA\Chinese History\Ancient Dynasties_files\xia(1).gif">), from about 
the twenty-first to the sixteenth century B.C. Until scientific excavations were 
made at early bronze-age sites at Anyang (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/an.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/yang.gif">), Henan (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/river.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/south.gif">) Province, in 1928, it was difficult to 
separate myth from reality in regard to the Xia. But since then, and especially 
in the 1960s and 1970s, archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze 
implements, and tombs that point to the existence of Xia civilization in the 
same locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts. At minimum, the Xia 
period marked an evolutionary stage between the late neolithic cultures and the 
typical Chinese urban civilization of the Shang dynasty.

<P>Thousands of archaeological finds in the Huang He (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/huang.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/river.gif">), Henan Valley (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/river.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/south.gif">) --the apparent cradle of Chinese 
civilization--provide evidence about the Shang (<IMG 
src="E:\UMA\Chinese History\Ancient Dynasties_files\shang(1).gif">) dynasty, 
which endured roughly from 1700 to 1027 B.C. The Shang dynasty (also called the 
Yin (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/yin.gif">) dynasty in its later stages) 
is believed to have been founded by a rebel leader who overthrew the last Xia 
ruler. Its civilization was based on agriculture, augmented by hunting and 
animal husbandry. Two important events of the period were the development of a 
writing system, as revealed in archaic Chinese inscriptions found on <IMG 
align=left alt="[Picture of Oracle Bone]" border=1 height=169 hspace=10 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/oraclesm.jpg" vspace=5 width=102> tortoise shells 
and flat cattle bones (commonly called oracle bones or <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/oraclebones.gif">), and the use of bronze 
metallurgy. A number of ceremonial bronze vessels with inscriptions date from 
the Shang period; the workmanship on the bronzes attests to a high level of 
civilization. <IMG align=right alt="[Picture of Bronze Pot]" border=1 height=122 
hspace=10 src="Ancient Dynasties_files/shangpotsm.jpg" vspace=5 width=75> 
<P>A line of hereditary Shang kings ruled over much of northern China, and Shang 
troops fought frequent wars with neighboring settlements and nomadic herdsmen 
from the inner Asian steppes. The capitals, one of which was at the site of the 
modern city of Anyang, were centers of glittering court life. Court rituals to 
propitiate spirits and to honor sacred ancestors were highly developed. In 
addition to his secular position, the king was the head of the ancestor- and 
spirit-worship cult. Evidence from the royal tombs indicates that royal 
personages were buried with articles of value, presumably for use in the 
afterlife. Perhaps for the same reason, hundreds of commoners, who may have been 
slaves, were buried alive with the royal corpse.

<H2>The Zhou Period</H2></A><IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/zhou.gif"> 
<P><IMG align=left alt="[Map of Zhou]" border=1 height=241 hspace=10 
src="E:\UMA\Chinese History\Ancient Dynasties_files\zhou(1).gif" vspace=5 
width=238> The last Shang ruler, a despot according to standard Chinese 
accounts, was overthrown by a chieftain of a frontier tribe called Zhou (<IMG 
src="E:\UMA\Chinese History\Ancient Dynasties_files\zhou(2).gif">), which had 
settled in the Wei (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/weiriver.gif">) Valley in 
modern Shaanxi (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/shan.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/west.gif">) Province. The Zhou dynasty had its 
capital at Hao (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/hao.gif">), near the city of 
<A href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~yxh/tourism.html">Xi'an</A> (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/west.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/an.gif">), or Chang'an (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/long.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/an.gif">), as it was known in its heyday in the 
imperial period. Sharing the language and culture of the Shang, the early Zhou 
rulers, through conquest and colonization, gradually sinicized, that is, 
extended Shang culture through much of China Proper north of the Chang Jiang 
(<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/long.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/jiang.gif"> or Yangtze River). The Zhou dynasty 
lasted longer than any other, from 1027 to 221 B.C. It was philosophers of this 
period who first enunciated the doctrine of the "mandate of heaven" (tianming or 
<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/tian.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/life.gif">), the notion that the ruler (the "son of 
heaven" or <IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/tian.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/zi.gif">) governed by divine right but that his 
dethronement would prove that he had lost the mandate. The doctrine explained 
and justified the demise of the two earlier dynasties and at the same time 
supported the legitimacy of present and future rulers. 
<P>The term feudal has often been applied to the Zhou period because the Zhou's 
early decentralized rule invites comparison with medieval rule in Europe. At 
most, however, the early Zhou system was proto-feudal (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/feudal.gif">), being a more sophisticated version 
of earlier tribal organization, in which effective control depended more on 
familial ties than on feudal legal bonds. Whatever feudal elements there may 
have been decreased as time went on. The Zhou amalgam of city-states became 
progressively centralized and established increasingly impersonal political and 
economic institutions. These developments, which probably occurred in the latter 
Zhou period, were manifested in greater central control over local governments 
and a more routinized agricultural taxation. 
<P>In 771 B.C. the Zhou court was sacked, and its king was killed by invading 
barbarians who were allied with rebel lords. The capital was moved eastward to 
Luoyang (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/luo.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/yang.gif">) in present-day Henan (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/river.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/south.gif">) Province. Because of this shift, 
historians divide the Zhou era into Western Zhou (1027-771 B.C.) and Eastern 
Zhou (770-221 B.C.). With the royal line broken, the power of the Zhou court 
gradually diminished; the fragmentation of the kingdom accelerated. Eastern Zhou 
divides into two subperiods. The first, from 770 to 476 B.C., is called the 
Spring and Autumn Period (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/spring-fall.gif"> 
<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/period.gif">), after a famous historical 
chronicle of the time; the second is known as the Warring States Period (475-221 
B.C. <IMG src="Ancient Dynasties_files/warring.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties_files/period.gif">).
