<H1>The Ancient Dynasties: II</H1></CENTER><A name=hundred>
<H2>The Hundred Schools of Thought</H2></A>The Spring and Autumn and Warring 
States periods, though marked by disunity and civil strife, witnessed an 
unprecedented era of cultural prosperity--the "golden age" (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/huang.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/gold.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/period.gif">) of China. The atmosphere of reform 
and new ideas was attributed to the struggle for survival among warring regional 
lords who competed in building strong and loyal armies and in increasing 
economic production to ensure a broader base for tax collection. To effect these 
economic, military, and cultural developments, the regional lords needed 
ever-increasing numbers of skilled, literate officials and teachers, the 
recruitment of whom was based on merit. Also during this time, commerce was 
stimulated through the introduction of coinage and technological improvements. 
Iron came into general use, making possible not only the forging of weapons of 
war but also the manufacture of farm implements. Public works on a grand 
scale--such as flood control, irrigation projects, and canal digging--were 
executed. Enormous walls were built around cities and along the broad stretches 
of the northern frontier. 
<P>So many different philosophies developed during the late Spring and Autumn 
and early Warring States periods that the era is often known as that of the 
Hundred Schools of Thought (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/hundred-thought.gif">). From the Hundred Schools 
of Thought came many of the great classical writings on which Chinese practices 
were to be based for the next two and one-half millennia. Many of the thinkers 
were itinerant intellectuals who, besides teaching their disciples, were 
employed as advisers to one or another of the various state rulers on the 
methods of government, war, and diplomacy. 
<P>The body of thought that had the most enduring effect on subsequent Chinese 
life was that of the School of Literati (ru or <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/ru.gif">), often called the Confucian school in 
the West. The written legacy of the School of Literati is embodied in the 
Confucian Classics (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/wujin.gif"> -- <A 
href="http://www.cnd.org/BIG5/Classics/Philosophers/I_Ching-TOC.b5.html"><IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/yijin.gif"></A>, <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/shijin.gif">, <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/shujin.gif">, <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/zhouli.gif">, and <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/spring-fall.gif"> from which the period derived 
its name), which were to become the basis for the order of traditional society. 
Confucius (551-479 B.C.), also called <A 
href="http://convex.cc.uky.edu/~jatuck00/Resources/Confucius.html">Kong Zi</A>, 
(<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/kong.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/zi.gif">) or Master Kong, looked to the early 
days of Zhou rule for an ideal social and political order. He believed that the 
only way such a system could be made to work properly was for each person to act 
according to prescribed relationships. "Let the ruler be a ruler and the subject 
a subject," (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/junjun.gif">) he said, but he 
added that to rule properly a king must be virtuous. To Confucius, the functions 
of government and social stratification were facts of life to be sustained by 
ethical values. His ideal was the junzi (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/jun.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/zi.gif"> or ruler's son), which came to mean 
gentleman in the sense of a cultivated or superior man. 
<P>Mencius (372-289 B.C.), or <A 
href="http://www.cnd.org/BIG5/Classics/Philosophers/Meng_Zi/">Meng Zi</A> (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/meng.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/zi.gif">), was a Confucian disciple who made 
major contributions to the humanism of Confucian thought. Mencius declared that 
man was by nature good. He expostulated the idea that a ruler could not govern 
without the people's tacit consent and that the penalty for unpopular, despotic 
rule was the loss of the "mandate of heaven." 
<P>The effect of the combined work of Confucius, the codifier and interpreter of 
a system of relationships based on ethical behavior, and Mencius, the 
synthesizer and developer of applied Confucian thought, was to provide 
traditional Chinese society with a comprehensive framework on which to order 
virtually every aspect of life 
<P>There were to be accretions to the corpus of Confucian thought, both 
immediately and over the millennia, and from within and outside the Confucian 
school. Interpretations made to suit or influence contemporary society made 
Confucianism dynamic while preserving a fundamental system of model behavior 
based on ancient texts. 
<P>Diametrically opposed to Mencius, for example, was the interpretation of <A 
href="http://www.cnd.org/BIG5/Classics/Philosophers/OnLearning.b5.html">Xun 
Zi</A> (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/xun.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/zi.gif"> ca. 300-237 B.C.), another Confucian 
follower. Xun Zi preached that man is innately selfish and evil and that 
goodness is attainable only through education and conduct befitting one's 
status. He also argued that the best government is one based on authoritarian 
control, not ethical or moral persuasion. 
<P>Xun Zi's unsentimental and authoritarian inclinations were developed into the 
doctrine embodied in the School of Law (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/fa.gif"> or fa), or Legalism. The doctrine was 
formulated by Han Fei Zi (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/hanfei.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/zi.gif"> d. 233 B.C.) and Li Si (<A 
href="http://www.cnd.org/BIG5/Classics/Prose/Expelling_Guests.b5.html"><IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/lisi.gif"></A> d. 208 B.C.), who maintained that 
human nature was incorrigibly selfish and therefore the only way to preserve the 
social order was to impose discipline from above and to enforce laws strictly. 
The Legalists exalted the state and sought its prosperity and martial prowess 
above the welfare of the common people. Legalism became the philosophic basis 
for the imperial form of government. When the most practical and useful aspects 
of Confucianism and Legalism were synthesized in the Han period (206 B.C.-A.D. 
220), a system of governance came into existence that was to survive largely 
intact until the late nineteenth century. Taoism (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/dao.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/jia.gif">), the second most important stream of 
Chinese thought, also developed during the Zhou period. Its formulation is 
attributed to the legendary sage Lao Zi (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/laozi.gif"> or Old Master), said to predate 
Confucius, and <A 
href="http://www.cnd.org/BIG5/Classics/Philosophers/Zhuang_Zi/">Zhuang Zi</A> 
(<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/zhuang.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/zi.gif">) (369-286 B.C.). The focus of Taoism is 
the individual in nature rather than the individual in society. It holds that 
the goal of life for each individual is to find one's own personal adjustment to 
the rhythm of the natural (and supernatural) world, to follow the Way (dao) of 
the universe. In many ways the opposite of rigid Confucian moralism, Taoism 
served many of its adherents as a complement to their ordered daily lives. A 
scholar on duty as an official would usually follow Confucian teachings but at 
leisure or in retirement might seek harmony with nature as a Taoist recluse. <!-- Added by Leon -->The Taoist approach to life is embodied in the classic <A 
href="http://www.chinapage.com/laotze.html">Dao De Jing</A> (<A 
href="http://www.mordor.com/pei/laotze2n.html"><IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/daodejin.gif"></A>). <!-- Added by Leon -->
<P>Another strain of thought dating to the Warring States Period is the school 
of yin-yang (<IMG src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/ying.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/yang.gif">) and the five elements. The theories 
of this school attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in 
nature, the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang 
(light, hot, male, positive) and the five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, 
and earth). In later periods these theories came to have importance both in 
philosophy and in popular belief. 
<P>Still another school of thought was based on the doctrine of Mo Zi (<IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/mo.gif"> <IMG 
src="Ancient Dynasties II_files/zi.gif"> 470-391 B.C.?), or Mo Di. Mo Zi 
believed that "all men are equal before God" and that mankind should follow 
heaven by practicing universal love. Advocating that all action must be 
utilitarian, Mo Zi condemned the Confucian emphasis on ritual and music. He 
regarded warfare as wasteful and advocated pacificism. Mo Zi also believed that 
unity of thought and action were necessary to achieve social goals. He 
maintained that the people should obey their leaders and that the leaders should 
follow the will of heaven. Although Moism failed to establish itself as a major 
school of thought, its views are said to be "strongly echoed" in Legalist 
thought. In general, the teachings of Mo Zi left an indelible impression on the 
Chinese mind.
