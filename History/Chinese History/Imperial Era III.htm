<H1>The Imperial Era: III</H1></CENTER>
<P><A name=mongol>

<P>By the mid-thirteenth century, the <A 
href="http://www.bluemarble.net/~mitch/mong/cult.html">Mongols</A> had 
subjugated north China, Korea, and the Muslim kingdoms of Central Asia and had 
twice penetrated Europe. With the resources of his vast empire, Kublai Khan 
(<IMG src="Imperial Era III_files/kublai.gif"> 1215-94), a grandson of <A 
href="http://spruce.evansville.edu/~al22/genghis.html">Genghis Khan</A> (<IMG 
src="Imperial Era III_files/genghis.gif"> 1167?-1227) and the supreme leader of 
all Mongol tribes, began his drive against the Southern Song. Even before the 
extinction of the Song dynasty, Kublai Khan had established the first alien 
dynasty to rule all China--the Yuan (1279-1368). 
<P>Although the Mongols sought to govern China through traditional institutions, 
using Chinese (Han) bureaucrats, they were not up to the task. The Han were 
discriminated against socially and politically. All important central and 
regional posts were monopolized by Mongols, who also preferred employing 
non-Chinese from other parts of the Mongol domain--Central Asia, the Middle 
East, and even Europe--in those positions for which no Mongol could be found. 
Chinese were more often employed in non-Chinese regions of the empire. 
<P>As in other periods of alien dynastic rule of China, a rich cultural 
diversity developed during the Yuan dynasty. The major cultural achievements 
were the development of drama and the novel and the increased use of the written 
vernacular. The Mongols' extensive West Asian and European contacts produced a 
fair amount of cultural exchange. Western musical instruments were introduced to 
enrich the Chinese performing arts. From this period dates the conversion to 
Islam, by Muslims of Central Asia, of growing numbers of Chinese in the 
northwest and southwest. Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism also enjoyed a 
period of toleration. Lamaism (Tibetan Buddhism) flourished, although native 
Taoism endured Mongol persecutions. Confucian governmental practices and 
examinations based on the Classics, which had fallen into disuse in north China 
during the period of disunity, were reinstated by the Mongols in the hope of 
maintaining order over Han society. Advances were realized in the fields of 
travel literature, cartography and geography, and scientific education. Certain 
key Chinese innovations, such as printing techniques, porcelain production, 
playing cards, and medical literature, were introduced in Europe, while the 
production of thin glass and cloisonne became popular in China. The first 
records of travel by Westerners date from this time. The most famous traveler of 
the period was the Venetian Marco Polo, whose account of his trip to "Cambaluc," 
the Great Khan's capital (now Beijing), and of life there astounded the people 
of Europe. The Mongols undertook extensive public works. Road and water 
communications were reorganized and improved. To provide against possible 
famines, granaries were ordered built throughout the empire. The city of Beijing 
was rebuilt with new palace grounds that included artificial lakes, hills and 
mountains, and parks. During the Yuan period, Beijing became the terminus of the 
Grand Canal, which was completely renovated. These commercially oriented 
improvements encouraged overland as well as maritime commerce throughout Asia 
and facilitated the first direct Chinese contacts with Europe. Chinese and 
Mongol travelers to the West were able to provide assistance in such areas as 
hydraulic engineering, while bringing back to the Middle Kingdom new scientific 
discoveries and architectural innovations. Contacts with the West also brought 
the introduction to China of a major new food crop--sorghum--along with other 
foreign food products and methods of preparation.

width=240> Rivalry among the Mongol imperial heirs, natural disasters, and 
numerous peasant uprisings led to the collapse of the Yuan dynasty. The Ming 
dynasty (1368-1644) was founded by a Han Chinese peasant and former Buddhist 
monk turned rebel army leader (<IMG src="Imperial Era III_files/zhuyuan.gif">). 
Having its capital first at Nanjing (<IMG 
src="Imperial Era III_files/south.gif"> <IMG 
src="Imperial Era III_files/capital.gif"> which means Southern Capital) and 
later at Beijing (<IMG src="Imperial Era III_files/north.gif"> <IMG 
src="Imperial Era III_files/capital.gif"> or Northern Capital), the Ming reached 
the zenith of power during the first quarter of the fifteenth century. The 
Chinese armies reconquered Annam (<IMG src="Imperial Era III_files/an.gif"> <IMG 
src="Imperial Era III_files/south.gif">), as northern Vietnam was then known, in 
Southeast Asia and kept back the Mongols, while the Chinese fleet sailed the 
China seas and the Indian Ocean, cruising as far as the east coast of Africa. 
The maritime Asian nations sent envoys with tribute for the Chinese emperor. 
Internally, the Grand Canal was expanded to its farthest limits and proved to be 
a stimulus to domestic trade. 
<P>The Ming maritime expeditions stopped rather suddenly after 1433, the date of 
the last voyage. Historians have given as one of the reasons the great expense 
of large-scale expeditions at a time of preoccupation with northern defenses 
against the Mongols. Opposition at court also may have been a contributing 
factor, as conservative officials found the concept of expansion and commercial 
ventures alien to Chinese ideas of government. Pressure from the powerful 
Neo-Confucian bureaucracy led to a revival of strict agrarian-centered society. 
The stability of the Ming dynasty, which was without major disruptions of the 
population (then around 100 million), economy, arts, society, or politics, 
promoted a belief among the Chinese that they had achieved the most satisfactory 
civilization on earth and that nothing foreign was needed or welcome. 
<P>Long wars with the Mongols, incursions by the Japanese into Korea, and 
harassment of Chinese coastal cities by the Japanese in the sixteenth century 
weakened Ming rule, which became, as earlier Chinese dynasties had, ripe for an 
alien takeover. In 1644 the Manchus (<IMG 
src="Imperial Era III_files/manchu.gif">) took Beijing from the north and became 
masters of north China, establishing the last imperial dynasty, the Qing 
(1644-1911). 
<P><A name=manchus>
<H2>The Rise of the Manchus</H2></A><A name=qing><IMG

<P><IMG align=left alt="[Map of Qing]" border=1 height=244 hspace=10 
src="E:\UMA\Chinese History\Imperial Era III_files\qing(1).gif" vspace=5 
width=241> Although the Manchus were not Han Chinese and were strongly resisted, 
especially in the south, they had assimilated a great deal of Chinese culture 
before conquering China Proper. Realizing that to dominate the empire they would 
have to do things the Chinese way, the Manchus retained many institutions of 
Ming and earlier Chinese derivation. They continued the Confucian court 
practices and temple rituals, over which the emperors had traditionally 
presided. 
<P>The Manchus continued the Confucian civil service system. Although Chinese 
were barred from the highest offices, Chinese officials predominated over Manchu 
officeholders outside the capital, except in military positions. The 
Neo-Confucian philosophy, emphasizing the obedience of subject to ruler, was 
enforced as the state creed. The Manchu emperors also supported Chinese literary 
and historical projects of enormous scope; the survival of much of China's 
ancient literature is attributed to these projects. 
<P>Ever suspicious of Han Chinese, the Qing rulers put into effect measures 
aimed at preventing the absorption of the Manchus into the dominant Han Chinese 
population. Han Chinese were prohibited from migrating into the Manchu homeland, 
and Manchus were forbidden to engage in trade or manual labor. Intermarriage 
between the two groups was forbidden. In many government positions a system of 
dual appointments was used--the Chinese appointee was required to do the 
substantive work and the Manchu to ensure Han loyalty to Qing rule. 
<P>The Qing regime was determined to protect itself not only from internal 
rebellion but also from foreign invasion. After China Proper had been subdued, 
the Manchus conquered Outer Mongolia (now the Mongolian People's Republic) in 
the late seventeenth century. In the eighteenth century they gained control of 
Central Asia as far as the Pamir Mountains and established a protectorate over 
the area the Chinese call Xizang (<IMG src="Imperial Era III_files/xizang.gif">) 
but commonly known in the West as Tibet. The Qing thus became the first dynasty 
to eliminate successfully all danger to China Proper from across its land 
borders. Under Manchu rule the empire grew to include a larger area than before 
or since; Taiwan, the last outpost of anti-Manchu resistance, was also 
incorporated into China for the first time. In addition, Qing emperors received 
tribute from the various border states. 
<P>The chief threat to China's integrity did not come overland, as it had so 
often in the past, but by sea, reaching the southern coastal area first. Western 
traders, missionaries, and soldiers of fortune began to arrive in large numbers 
even before the Qing, in the sixteenth century. The empire's inability to 
evaluate correctly the nature of the new challenge or to respond flexibly to it 
resulted in the demise of the Qing and the collapse of the entire millennia-old 
framework of dynastic rule.
